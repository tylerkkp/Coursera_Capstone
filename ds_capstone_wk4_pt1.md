## Week 4 - Problem Statement

Beer tourism is becoming increasingly common, and (fortunately) there is an abundance of choices for destinations. According to [this article](https://fortune.com/2019/08/06/new-craft-breweries-2019-data/), over 1,000 opened in 2018. That's a bit less than 3 per day! One of the more popular cities for beer tourism is Portland, Oregon. I went to college in Portland, but was underage and did not have the palate for good beer at the time. However, in the years since leaving Portland, I've become increasingly involved in the craft beer industry. Most recently, I started contributing to the OpenBreweryDB project, which seeks to catalog craft breweries across the USA and the world (currently including England and Scotland, although additional countries are anticipated in the future). 

As with many large cities, Portland has quite a few distinct neighborhoods, each with its own unique personality and characteristics. It is also an interesting city in that it is bisected by a river. The industrial and business districts are mostly on the West side of the river, and the neighborhoods are to the East. Breweries are all over the place. However, our aim with this project will be to find the _best_ neighborhood for beer - a rather high honor in a city with so many great breweries.
