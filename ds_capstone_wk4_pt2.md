## The Data

In this project I will be looking at the neighborhoods as defined on the City of Portland Open Data portal [here](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/neighborhoods-regions?geometry=-123.656%2C45.374%2C-121.678%2C45.711). I will also be using the [OpenBreweryDB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) dataset, either through directly downloading the dataset, or using the API. I want to do a couple of analyses. In the spirit of 'Battle of Neighborhoods', I want to see which neighborhood can claim:

1. The most breweries
2. The 'best' breweries based on Foursquare reviews
3. Whatever else I can see from the initial exploratory analysis

The OpenBreweryDB dataset has a number of interesting datapoints which could provide some insights. For example, the predominant 'type' of brewery in a neighborhood. Brewpubs and other similar establishments would likely be more prevalent in tourist areas, and larger breweries would be found in more industrial areas where land and rent are cheaper. I would expect Nano and Micro Breweries to be in neighborhoods since they could be sustained by a small local population. My analysis will help determine if my assumptions hold true.
